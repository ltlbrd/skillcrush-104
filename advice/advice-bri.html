			<h4>Use the Free Resources</h4>
			<p>While most of the best courses on development and design are paid-for, there are a lot of reference sources and images available online for free. From coding references to fonts to stock and vector images, other developers and designers have offered their knowledge and talents from their own generosity and desire to increase the general knowledge base. These resources are here for you to use, so dig in!</p>

			<p>A classic for a reason, <a href="http://www.w3girls.com" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a> is the largest web developer site and offers wonderful, no-frills reference. When you are stuck or want to push your knowledge further they have everything you need, including straightforward reference and responsive web templates. They even offer certificates in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Make sure to check out their super-handy<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp" target="_blank">color picker</a>!</p>

			<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash</a> is one of my favorite sources of free stock photos. Not only is it full of a wide variety of images, the images they offer are more artistic and interesting than typical stock shots.
			</p>

			<p>There is a free resource included right in your web browser: View Source! Also known as Developer Tools in Chrome, this allows you to peek behind the curtain of websites whose design interests you and even tweak things to get a better understanding of how the code functions.

			<h4>Be Okay with Messing Up (Google it!)</h4>
			<p>You may try over and over to acheive a certain layout or design scheme without hitting the mark, but that is totally okay. You will need to look up a lot of answers as you learn, and there is no single perfect way to do anything in web design. </p>

			<p>You might even discover something new you hadn't thought of while looking up the answers to another problem!</p>
